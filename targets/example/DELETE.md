This is meant to be an absolute minimum example file. This should have everything (and only everything) that a CAN project would need to exist. It should be the best spot to duplicate to start from so that they can be sure they're not missing anything, with "TODO: " comments left in all the spots that have base example values that must be replaced before being pushed
This one is called DELETE.md because the README.md will be the one that is in the final repo and it will have TODOs of its own
One thing gotta consider is how they can "copy" this project since stm32 is weird with that kind of thing. Also if they have a slightly different board I don't want this copy to be completely useless if possible. Maybe the examples can be per board as well as we create support for each board? Since if we do something on one board chances are we'll have more than one project on that same board. Or the example could have some comment surrounding each thing that was added so they know what to copy over to their new project (alongside some basic instructions in setting up CAN on ioc incase we forget for easy reference). Not sure worth thinking about but def not urgent.
