Current build arch plan is motivated by two wants:
1. We want it to be easy to update the common CAN files if necessary, and to allow this we have a monorepo so that we can update the common files at the same time as making any necessary changes to relevant targets all in the same PR
2. We do not want builds to break for targets we no longer care to support. If we were submoduling the common CAN files then we could pick a specific commit for the submodule and not have to worry about the common files changing over time. However, we are not doing this for the reason above.

So the solution is to continue updating the common files, and whenever we make a revision that is going to break an interface for example, (or could just be any revision in general), we tag it and make an artifact. Then each target in their build config specification mention which revision of the common files they want to use or "latest". The expectation being that targets point to "latest" up until we do not care to support them anymore in which case they point to the last revision they support. This way, we do not have to maintain revisions we dont care about whenever we make changes to common, but we are able to still build them and make tweaks to them if necessary without causing any issues.
